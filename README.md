# üß≠ CHAMBRS Docs-as-Code Repository

A structured, version-controlled documentation system designed for **CHAMBRS**, enabling transparency, traceability, and scalability from the earliest stages of product and compliance development.

This repository follows a **Docs-as-Code** approach ‚Äî all documentation lives as Markdown in Git, versioned and reviewed through Pull Requests, ensuring every change is **auditable** and **collaboratively managed**.

---

## üìò Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Maintain a **single source of truth** for all CHAMBRS documentation.
- Enable **transparent change tracking** across product, architecture, and compliance domains.
- Support both **technical** and **non-technical** teams through clear versioning and traceability.
- Allow automated changelog generation and markdown validation for governance.

## üîó Key Artifacts

| Category | Description | Purpose |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Business Docs** | User & functional requirements | Capture what the platform should do |
| **Technical Docs** | Architecture blueprints & ADRs | Define how it should be built |
| **AI Prompts (Lovable)** | Functional & non-functional meta-prompts | Record AI-driven product scaffolding |
| **Governance Docs** | Compliance & risk registers | Support FSCA/FSP/ODP and internal controls |
| **Operations Docs** | Infra blueprints & diagrams | Capture deployment, environment, and topology |

---

## üß© Traceability & Transparency

Every artifact is linked in **`traceability-index.md`**, providing a live mapping between:
- Requirements ‚Üí Architecture Decisions ‚Üí Prompts ‚Üí Compliance Registers ‚Üí Blueprints

Example entry:
```markdown
| Functional Requirements | docs/01_business/functional-requirements.md | ADR-001 | docs/03_ai_prompts/lovable/functional-prompts.md | v0.1 |
````

This ensures *auditability* and *context preservation* across every documentation change.
